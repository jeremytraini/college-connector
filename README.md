### The A* Search Algorithm

One of the standout features of College Connector is its incorporation of the A* search algorithm for pathfinding. A* is renowned for its efficiency and accuracy in determining the shortest path from a starting point to a destination.

Here's how I've used it:

1. **Node-Based Map**: Our digital map is based on nodes, representing walkways, locations and intersections on the campus.
2. **Heuristic Approach**: The A* algorithm uses heuristics, which are estimates of the cost to reach the destination from a particular node. This includes weightings for hills and staircases and ensures that the search is always directed towards the most promising paths.
3. **Dynamic Pathfinding**: As users search for destinations, the A* algorithm dynamically calculates the most efficient route, taking into account various factors like distance, obstacles, and predefined pathways.

This advanced pathfinding capability ensures that users can trust College Connector to guide them quickly and accurately to their desired locations.
